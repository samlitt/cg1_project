# Minimum Requirements:
- [ ] README-file with information for running and using the program
- [ ] multiple objects in a 3D scene
- [x] animation of the camera and/or of one object
- [x] lighting of the scene as described in the course
- [x] texturing of at least one object

# For a good grade (more is better):
- [x] import of geometry data from a seperate file
- [x] Splitting up the code in multiple files (espcially shader code as seperate files)
- [x] simple user interaction of camera and/or objects (eg. via keyboard)
- [ ] transparent objects
- [x] lighting of the scene with more then one light source
- [ ] simultaneous use of at least two textures in one object
- [x] simultaneous use of at least two different shader programs in one scene
- [x] use of an environment texture
- [x] ambient texture reflection on some objects
- [ ] fog in a complex 3D scene
- [x] use of a video texture

**For a particularly good grade, you will be required to implement at least one advanced technique, for which you will need to research the necessary details on your own.**
